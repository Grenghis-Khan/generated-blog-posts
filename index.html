          ASPPB is developing a new single-session competence-based version of
          the EPPP for 2025, aiming for more efficient, integrated evaluation

        A major celebration in professional psychology in 2025 is the <strong>60th
        anniversary of the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology
        (EPPP)</strong>, established by the Association of State and Provincial
        Psychology Boards (ASPPB). Since its inception in 1965, the EPPP has
        become the gold standard for assessing the readiness of psychologists
        to practice in the United States and Canada, currently used by 66 member
        jurisdictions. In 2024 alone, over 8,000 candidates took the exam,
        underlining its critical role in public protection by ensuring fair,
        consistent, and psychometrically sound licensure processes[1].
      </p>
      <p>
        This anniversary highlights <strong>six decades of commitment to rigorous
        professional assessment</strong> in psychology, specifically addressing
        competence in diagnosing and managing neurodevelopmental, neurobehavioral,
        cognitive, mood, and personality disorders. The EPPP's evolution
        reflects the field's dedication not only to maintaining high standards in
        licensure but also to adapting to contemporary needs. For 2025, the ASPPB
        is developing a single-session competence-based EPPP, signifying a shift
        toward more efficient and integrated evaluation methods while preserving
        psychometric reliability and fairness[1].
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the <strong>Assessment Institute at Indiana University</strong>,
        celebrating its standing as the oldest and largest higher education event
        focused on assessment and improvement, continues to provide a vital forum
        for advancing assessment practices, although its primary focus is on
        educational assessment rather than clinical diagnostics[3]. This event,
        held annually, offers extensive opportunities for professionals involved
        in assessment and measurement, including those working within psychology
        and related fields, to engage in knowledge exchange and skill enhancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the broader context of mental health and psychological diagnostics,
        <strong>ongoing scientific advancements funded by institutions like the
        National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</strong> are contributing to
        refined diagnostic tools and better understanding of disorders such as
        bipolar disorder, memory-related conditions, and suicide risk. While not
        an anniversary, 2025 sees these advances highlighted as part of the
        continuous evolution of psychological assessment and treatment techniques[2].
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these milestones and ongoing initiatives emphasize the dynamic
        history and forward momentum of institutions dedicated to psychological
        assessment and diagnosis, celebrating both legacy and innovation in the
        pursuit of effective mental health care.
