<p>Psychological assessments are essential for diagnostics and intervention planning across diverse settings, and in 2025 they are receiving refreshed contributions across cognitive tests, behavior rating scales, validity measures, and advanced psychometrics. The year’s upcoming publications emphasize cultural competence, methodological innovation, and forensic application, reflecting current priorities in the field.</p>

<p>Among the most notable forthcoming works is <strong>Forensic Mental Health Assessment with the MMPI-3</strong>, scheduled for January 2026 from University of Minnesota Press. Authored by Dustin B. Wygant and Martin Sellbom, it updates the influential Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory for forensic populations and provides modernized tools to enhance evaluation accuracy and legal relevance.</p>

<p>In measurement theory, David F. Feldon’s upcoming book introduces a novel <em>mixed methods approach</em> that integrates qualitative insights with quantitative data. Leveraging critical realism and latent variable theory, it aims to address complexities like measurement invariance and differential item function, broadening the foundations of research and clinical assessment methodology.</p>

<p>Cultural considerations in assessment are also being foregrounded in a comprehensive webinar series starting early 2025, sponsored by the Society for Personality Assessment and APA Division 12. This series, drawing on the publication <em>Essentials of Culture in Psychological Assessment</em>, equips clinicians to better recognize and reduce cultural biases in test interpretation, a critical evolution given growing client diversity.</p>

<p>Broad clinical and research applications will benefit from titles like the <strong>Handbook of the Behavior and Psychology of Disease</strong> (Springer, August 2026), offering interdisciplinary perspectives on behavior’s intersection with physical health, reflecting the increasing integration of psychological assessment within biopsychosocial models.</p>

<p>Other thematic works include <em>Psychopathy Unmasked</em> (MIT Press, 2025), which revisits diagnostic constructs with fresh insights. Meanwhile, classic cognitive and performance test batteries from traditional publishers such as Pearson and Riverside Insights have not announced new releases for 2025, indicating a trend toward refining assessment frameworks and interpretation over launching new instruments.</p>

<p>Additionally, McGraw-Hill is preparing an update titled <em>Psychological Testing and Assessment: 2025 Release</em>, signaling ongoing development in textbooks and classroom resources in this area.</p>

<p>Overall, 2025 publications and innovations in psychological assessment focus strongly on expanding validity through mixed research methods, enhancing cultural competence, and updating forensic tools, thereby advancing nuanced and equitable evaluation practices.</p>
